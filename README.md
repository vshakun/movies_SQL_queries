# CS50-PSet-7-Movies

This is my SQL queries to answer questions about a database of movies, for Harvard's CS50 problems set 7.

## Specifications:

For each of the following problems, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query, though you may nest other queries inside of your query. 

You should not assume anything about the ids of any particular movies or people: your queries should be accurate even if the id of any particular movie or person were different. 

Finally, each query should return only the data necessary to answer the question: if the problem only asks you to output the names of movies, for example, then your query should not also output the each movieâ€™s release year.
